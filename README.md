FastAPI Todo App
Overview

This is a beginner-friendly backend project built with FastAPI and Pydantic, demonstrating CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using in-memory storage.The project simulates a task management system where users can create, view, update and delete todos  similar to what a small backend API would do in a real-world application.
While this is primarily a backend project, it was developed with the help of generative AI (ChatGPT) to:

Scaffold endpoints and Pydantic models
Implement error handling for missing or duplicate todos
Generate example requests and README documentation

The AI Prompt Journal included in this repository shows exactly how AI was used to assist learning and implementation.This project was completed as part of the Moringa School backend development learning track.
